This task I worked closely with fellow bootcamper Joe Walsh. We decided to focus on the Pokemon API and had a vision of created a working pokedex that would allow users to search a pokemon and retrieve the respective pokemons information.

We found a pokedex template on the internet and then modified it to suit our needs and hooked up the API to render out information that we wanted to.

Overall this project was a lot of fun and we are both really pleased with how it turned out.
